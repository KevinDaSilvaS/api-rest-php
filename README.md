# api-rest-php
API REST made with php and mysql, 
to create a user subscribe table,that was my first api rest that included the entire application crud 
and it was very nice and fun to implement it.At the end i learn a lot by finishing this project

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Requisition</th>
      <th>Example</th>
      <th>Fields</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Requisition</td>
      <td>Example</td>
      <th>Fields</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
